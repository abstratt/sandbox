MySQL questions:

1) Never had to use a generated value in MySQL, but there you go.

2) I can't really get any credit for this one, found the solution on a blog. 
I got away so far with never having to write database functions or stored procedures in my career 
so that was lucky. I have worked in systems that strived to be DB-agnostic, I guess that explains it.

3) In this exercise I learned how involved it can be to generate a sequence in MySQL. Wished there was a way 
of extracting a substring between delimiters, had to resource to reversing the string to remove the prefix and suffix. 

4) Another case I had to jump through hoops to generate a range of values (StackOverflow helped a lot there). 
Is that really the best way to generate a series of dates in MySQL?
